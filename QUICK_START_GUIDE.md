## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### YouTube Rate Limiting

If you see "rate-limited" errors:
- **Wait 30-60 minutes** between channel analyses
- YouTube limits how fast you can request video data
- This is normal and protects against abuse

**Pro Tip**: Analyze channels during off-peak hours (early morning/late night)

### Best Practices

‚úÖ **DO**:
- Analyze channels with 20+ videos for meaningful patterns
- Focus on active channels (recent uploads)
- Compare multiple channels in your niche
- Look for replicable patterns, not one-time lucky breaks

‚ùå **DON'T**:
- Run back-to-back analyses (wait between channels)
- Expect identical results (adapt to your unique voice)
- Copy content exactly (use insights for inspiration)
- Analyze private/restricted channels
